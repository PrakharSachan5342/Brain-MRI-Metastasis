# 🧠 Brain MRI Metastasis Segmentation

## 🌟 Project Overview
The **Brain MRI Metastasis Segmentation** application is designed to assist in the identification and segmentation of brain metastases from MRI images. This application utilizes **FastAPI** for the backend and **Streamlit** for the frontend, providing a user-friendly interface for uploading MRI images and receiving segmented results.

## 🛠️ Features
- 📤 **Upload** Brain MRI images in PNG, JPG, or JPEG format.
- 🔍 **Process** images using a segmentation model (currently a placeholder).
- 🖼️ **Display** uploaded and segmented images.
- 📥 **Download** segmented images for further analysis.
- 💻 **User-friendly interface** with loading indicators and error messages.

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- **Backend**: FastAPI
- **Frontend**: Streamlit
- **Image Processing**: OpenCV, PIL
- **Python Packages**: numpy, requests

## 📋 Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
- 🐍 Python 3.7 or later
- 📦 pip (Python package installer)

## ⚙️ Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PrakharSachan5342/Brain-MRI-Metastasis.git
   cd Brain-MRI-Metastasis
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   # On Windows
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   # On macOS/Linux
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install the required packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 🏃‍♂️ Running the Application
1. **Start the FastAPI backend**:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

2. **In another terminal, start the Streamlit app**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

3. **Open your browser and navigate to** `http://localhost:8501` **to access the application**.

## 📥 Usage
1. **Upload a Brain MRI image** by dragging and dropping it into the designated area or clicking "Browse files".
2. The application will **process the image** and display the **segmented result**.
3. You can **download** the segmented image for further analysis.
